## Introduction

**CereLoX** is a user-friendly log analysis tool designed for everyone. Its mission is to provide security insights and peace of mind by making high-grade log analysis simple, without requiring technical expertise.

The core of CereLoX is its **on-device security model**. Unlike other services that require you to upload your sensitive system logs to the cloud, all analysis happens locally on your computer. Your files are never transmitted, never stored, and never seen by us. You hold the keys, you hold the data, and you have total control.
